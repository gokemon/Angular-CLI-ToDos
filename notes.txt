In the second part of this project I created a git branch, 
ComponentRefactoring.
I currently have a ToDo class to represent individual todos, 
a TodoDataService class to create, update and remove todos,
as well as my main AppComponent to display the user interface.

I plan to create:
a TodoListComponent to display a list of todo’s
a TodoListItemComponent to display a single todo
a TodoListHeaderComponent to create a new todo
a TodoListFooterComponent to show how many todo’s are left
